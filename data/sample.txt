This is a sample document. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval and generation to answer questions effectively.

Sample Document for RAG Pipeline

Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) approach that combines information retrieval with generative models to improve response accuracy and relevance. This document serves as a sample input for a RAG pipeline, containing structured and unstructured information.

Section 1: General Knowledge

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include natural language understanding, image recognition, and decision-making.

Section 2: Structured Data

Technology

Description

Example Use Case

Machine Learning

Algorithms that learn from data

Fraud detection

Deep Learning

Neural networks with multiple layers

Image classification

Natural Language Processing

Techniques for language understanding

Chatbots and virtual assistants

Section 3: Unstructured Data

Unstructured data refers to information that does not have a predefined format. Examples include emails, social media posts, and multimedia content. Unlike structured data, which fits neatly into tables, unstructured data requires advanced techniques such as vector embeddings for effective processing.

Section 4: Sample Query-Response Pair

Query: What is deep learning?

Response: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn representations of data. It is widely used in applications such as image and speech recognition.

Conclusion

This document exemplifies the type of content processed in a RAG pipeline. By combining structured and unstructured data, a RAG-based system can generate more informed and context-aware responses.
