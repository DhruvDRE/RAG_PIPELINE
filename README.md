# RAG_PIPELINE
This is a basic RAG pipeline. You can enhance it by: Adding support for PDFs or other file types in ingestion.py. Using a more powerful model in generator.py (e.g., facebook/rag-token-base). Optimizing FAISS with an IVF index in vector_store.py.

This RAG pipeline includes:

Data Ingestion: Load and preprocess documents.

Embedding Generation: Convert documents into vector embeddings.

Vector Store: Store embeddings in a vector database (FAISS).

Retriever: Retrieve relevant documents based on a query.

Generator: Generate answers using a language model.

Main Script: Tie everything together.

# RAG Pipeline

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built with Python, FAISS, and Hugging Face transformers.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-pipeline.git
   cd rag-pipeline
